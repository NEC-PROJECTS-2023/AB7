Text+Image multimodel search using MobileNet

 ABSTRACT

Multimodal search is a type of search that combines multiple modes of input to retrieve
relevant results from a collection of multimedia data. This includes text, images, audio, and
video data. Unlike traditional unimodal search, which only uses one type of input, multimodal
search takes advantage of the complementary information provided by different modes of
input.
The search process involves a combination of techniques from computer vision, natural
language processing, and speech recognition. The system extracts features from each mode of
input and then applies a machine learning algorithm to identify relevant results based on the
similarity between the features.
Multimodal search has numerous applications, such as in e-commerce, social media, and
digital libraries. It allows users to search for products, find similar images and videos, and
explore multimedia collections in a more intuitive and efficient way. In addition, multimodal
search has the potential to enable new applications in fields such as healthcare, where
multimodal data is becoming increasingly important for diagnosis and treatment.
